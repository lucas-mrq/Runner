## Runner
I am currently working on a runner in engineering school. A runner is a game in which a character runs and has to jump over obstacles (like the dinosaur on google when there is no connection). This project is adapted to all levels and aims at discovering all the concepts of object oriented. 

I display for the moment the player running and the background moving according to speed equations. I still have a lot of improvements to do and I'm only at the beginning (jumping, pressing keys, enemies, lives, boost, menu, comments).
