## Runner
I am currently working on a runner in engineering school. A runner is a game in which a character runs and has to jump over obstacles (like the dinosaur on google when there is no connection). This project is adapted to all levels and aims at discovering all the concepts of object oriented.

The player has the possibility to save his scores, shoot, jump or play endlessly if he can.

## Testing tools
The game starts easily. If the user wants to complicate the game quickly, he/she has the possibility to generate traps by pressing the "c" key or to generate eagles by pressing the "e" key.
